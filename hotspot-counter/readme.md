To request the number of hotspots in your city you need the Helium city\_id. To find the city\_id for your town anter the following url in your browser. Substitute "Apeldoorn" with the city you are looking for: 
```
https://api.helium.io/v1/cities?search=Apeldoorn
```

The city_id is used in the following url to retrieve a list of hotspots:

```

## About the flow
The flow requests at a regular interval the information from the Helium API with a inject-node. The HTTP-node receives the url from the function node. The answer from the Helium API is a json struct from which the number of hotspots and the number of active hotspots is counted. These numbers are presented to the Mustache node that creates the content of teh Tweet.
